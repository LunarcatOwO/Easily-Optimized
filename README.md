## This github repo is a Bug tracker for the following modpack

# Easily-Optimized
A simple Modpack that focuses on performance and graphics enhancements!


# Performance Increase!
Thanks to modern optimization mods including Sodium, Lithium, and Others!

# Feels familiar
As Easily Optimized does not change gameplay so it allows you to experience Minecraft as you remember it, no matter what version you used before! Easily Optimized Supports controllers too! (cool right?)

# Built on Fabric     
Easily Optimized uses the Fabric mod loader, which is lightweight, fast, and supports a lot of mods. You can even use it as a base to add your favorite mods to.
